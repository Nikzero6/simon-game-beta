## Styling
- Used Bootsrap and @media queries for a responsive web design.
- Animated border:
  - Used conic-gradient with three colors for border image.
  - animated different @keyframes by defining the @property rule for angle and varying it from 0 to 360 degrees.

## Logic
- Used JavaScript and jQuery for making the game logic.
- Used DOM module for selecting the selectors and changing their properties using javascript functions at the client side.
